# domenicopopolizio.github.io
My personal website.

As you can see, the index.html file, contains a redirect to the link where the hompage is hosted (https://domenicopopolizio.000webhostapp.com/),
so if you want to read the code of this page you should read the index.php file.
This website include both html and php pages:
All the html file are only hosted on github pages  (https://domenicopopolizio.github.io);
All the php file, instead, are hosted on 000webhostapp on the link above ( the sameof the index.php page), but all the codes are in this repository!

On the homepage of the site I also link to other project and/or repostory, separated from this one, but all the codes are public on 
github, and if, in any future project, they are not, I will insert a notice on the website.



p.s.
I'm italian, so sorry if my english is not perfect, it isn't my language, however I do my best :)
(That's also why in my code the most of the comment aren't in english, but in italian.)
